`Crow.PHP` uses Packagist repo format, so if you are looking for packages or want to make your own package, check [Here](https://packagist.org/)<br>
To activate it, just add this line to the first of your code:
```PHP
include('crow.php');

**Note**: _Crow.PHP auto updates, so adding it only once, and the newest version will always be installed._
<br>
**Another Note**: _The updates will affect you after some time, so be patient._
<br>
**A Last Note**: _Crow.PHP only updates when an HTTP GET request is made, but you can run it manually or use cron jobs. ( i prefer ~crow~ jobs )_
