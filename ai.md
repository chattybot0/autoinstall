# aidotpkg
Soo, What is `ai.pkg`?
<br>
aidotpkg is a dependecies file, using the crowphp format, we will soon add other formats. ( dis is the format rn cuz im a noob )
<br>
Template:
```CSS
crow:true
packs@
https://example.com/pub.pkg
https://example.com/stuff.pkg
```

you can put anything instead of `https://example.com/pub.pkg` and `https://example.com/stuff.pkg`, but seperate them by new lines.
